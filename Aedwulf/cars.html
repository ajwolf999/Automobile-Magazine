        <h3>Koenigsegg Agera </h3>
        <div>
           <width></width>
                <p><i>The new Koenigsegg Agera RS has its focus set firmly on the track but is still perfect for regular use on the road. It uses advanced technology developed during our exclusive Koenigsegg One:1 program, while maintaining all the functionality of previous S and R models. Such practicalities include a usable luggage compartment and a detachable hardtop that can be stowed internally for top-down motoring at any time.Agera RS enhancements include: advanced lightweight sound insulation, an all-new front splitter optimized for the track, front winglets, side skirts, advanced dynamic underbody flap system and a dynamically active rear spoiler for added down force (now up to 450 kg at 250 km/h). The RS also features improved side air outlets behind the front wheels, increased power and a raised rpm limit.
                    <br>Even with all this added functionality and equipment, we have still managed to lower the curb weight compared to the Agera S and R models, thanks to the use of advanced composites and layup techniques developed during the One:1 program.<br>On top of the standard equipment, the Agera RS also offers the option to choose the Koenigsegg active and self-levelling chassis package, 3G connected Pre-Active chassis setups, alternative aero packages, active sound cancellation and much more.<br>The engine – as with the previous Agera S – has been optimized for regular pump gas and now puts out an incredible 1160 bhp on regular petrol. That’s an astonishing 232 bhp per liter with perfect reliability.<br>In certain markets, the Agera RS can also be configured to run on E85 for even higher power levels, while the engine management system offers the ability to adjust on-the-fly to any fuel mix at any given time.<br>The Agera RS is the ultimate in road and track versatility. It offers the most extreme performance available today and yet is fully road legal, complying with safety standards and other necessary homologation requirements worldwide.<br>The RS will be handcrafted in only 25 examples, with 10 pre-sold prior to the first showing.</i></p></div>

            <h3>Lamborghini Aventador SV</h3>
            <div>
                <p><i>The groundbreaking innovations we introduced with the Aventador marked the beginning of a new era for super sports cars. With the Aventador SV Coupé we have completely redefined the concept.<br>The Superveloce has been designed as the sportiest Lamborghini ever, thanks to a further improved naturally aspirated V12 engine, engineering solutions geared to extreme lightness, and a mix of innovative technological features, such as the magnetorheological push-rod suspension and the Lamborghini Dynamic Steering system.<br>Every element of the SV has been developed following the “Design to Weight” concept, with the lowest possible weight and highest possible performance, to make it the fastest and most exciting Lamborghini of all time.<br>A super sports car in its purest form. Here are all the features and the technical specifications for the Lamborghini Aventador Superveloce Coupé.<br>What makes the new Lamborghini Aventador Superveloce Coupé unique is its outstanding dynamic behavior, stemming from an impeccable team effort. In fact, each component of the SV has been chosen and calibrated to obtain maximum performance with as little weight as possible, while still guaranteeing the precision of a world-class driving experience.
                    Though significantly reduced in weight, the short-stroke naturally aspirated V-12 engine has become even sportier, with a maximum power output of 750 CV and a maximum speed of up to 8,500 rpm.<br>To ensure full control of the car in all conditions – possible thanks to the preset STRADA, SPORT and CORSA driving modes – the electronically controlled 4WD is supported by the Lamborghini Dynamic Steering and magnetorheological push-rod suspension.</i></p>

                <h3>Buggati Chiron</h3>
                <div>
                    <p><i>The CHIRON is the fastest, most powerful, and exclusive production super sports car in BUGATTI’s history. Its sophisticated design, innovative technology, and iconic, performance-oriented form make it a unique masterpiece of art, form and technique, that pushes boundaries beyond imagination.<br>BUGATTI owes its distinctive character to a family of artists and engineers, and has always strived to offer the extraordinary, the unrivalled, the best. Every element of the CHIRON is a combination of reminiscence to its history and the most innovative technology. The result is a unique creation of enduring value, and breathtaking automotive accomplishment.<br>The heart of the CHIRON is its quad-turbocharged 8 l W16 engine. This unique masterpiece generates an incredible 1,500 hp and 1,600 Nm of torque, with an almost linear power output between 2,000 and 6,000 rpm. Four high-performing turbochargers work in a two-stage controlled configuration, and define this champion of performance. A remarkable 60,000 litres of air are pumped through the engine every minute.<br>Simultaneously, 800 litres of water per minute circulate through the CHIRON’s heart, and guarantee the cooling of the engine and generate the extraordinary power. The new titanium exhaust system, with reduced gas back pressure, boosts this performance further. To maximise the CHIRON’s engine power, lightweight materials, such as titan and carbon fibre, have been used wherever possible.</i></p>
